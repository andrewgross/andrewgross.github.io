  <p>I finally got around to giving <a href="https://dspy.ai/">DSPy</a> a real shot. I had heard some pretty polarizing opinions on it in the past. Some folks thought of it like another LangChain, overly complex and too much abstraction for a simple thing. The other camp stopped writing prompts by hand entirely and just DSPy use instead.  </p>
<p>My initial attempt a few months back to pick apart the (old) documentation lead to confusion and made my opinion lean towards the naysayers.  Signatures? Modules? It felt a bit abstract and the examples, at the time, were not very clear. However, coming back to this tool the past few days has been a much easier journey. The documentation is much cleaner and more consistent, and the examples are finally front and center.</p>
<p>My recommendation is to skip the <a href="https://dspy.ai/learn/">Learn DSPy</a> documentation entirely when starting. Instead, work through a few of their <a href="https://dspy.ai/tutorials/entity_extraction/">Tutorials</a>.  The first tutorial is on RAG, and to be honest, doing yet another document retrieval based tutorial might induce permanent cranial damage to me at this point, so I skipped it.  I jumped ahead to the <a href="https://dspy.ai/tutorials/entity_extraction/">entity extraction</a> example since it was much more relevant to my daily work, and it was incredible.</p>
<p>The example was generally pretty clear and concise, though I would recommend making sure you run <code>dspy.inspect_history(n=1)</code> after the initial test, before prompt optimization, to get a better feel for what has changed. That said, the workflow was great.  Being able to show up to a problem with a general statement or question, along with some labeled data, and automatically using that to bootstrap you way to a better prompt and few-shot examples is a dream. It will certainly save me a lot of time in the future.</p>
<p>The results were pretty impressive. Using <code>NousResearch/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct</code> at <code>BF16</code> on <code>vLLM</code>, the initial accuracy was approximately 52%.  Not too surprising given the lack of context or examples for what really needs to be extracted.  Running the tuning step brought it up to 92% after DSPy improved the prompt and selected several few shot examples. Obviously 92% isn't anything to write home about for simple entity extraction models, but as a starting point from ~250 total labeled examples, its pretty good. Especially considering I did nothing except define an extremely simple signature.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to building out some ideas for a human in the loop system with DSPy, some LLMs, and some clustering models along with fine tuning a BERT model to see how quickly you can go from zero to cleaned data at scale.  These tools should really get us to a point where we can have a human focused on the decision boundary and not wasting their time elsewhere in the dataset.</p>

<h3>Bonus</h3>
<p>Reviewing the optimized prompt did provide a few laughts. I am not sure if the following is because I used a slightly dated Llama3 model instead of proprietary APIs, but I found it amusing to see that the idea of "saying your grandma will die if the LLM fails" is alive and well:</p>
