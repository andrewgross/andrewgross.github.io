  <p>Trying out Pelican as a static site generator. An interesting thing I noticed with my development environment is that docker is not great at seeing inode changes in mounted volumes. My setup is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write changes in VSCode (laptop)</li>
<li>VSCode Remote-SSH Session (server) handles syncing those changes from my laptop</li>
<li>I have the files in a Git Repo (server)</li>
<li>I have the Git Repo as a mounted volume in a docker container</li>
<li>The Pelican server runs in the docker container with <code>--autoreload</code></li>
<li>The Pelican server does not notice changes to files and pick them up with autoreload.</li>
</ol>
<p>My best guess is that docker doesn't get to see inode events for its mounted drives, at least in my default configuration.  A little digging shows <a href="https://forums.docker.com/t/inotify-is-not-triggering-any-events-in-docker-when-we-mount-it-from-the-host/104570">this</a> issue from 2021. Seems like some folks don't see this same issue. Not worth the deep dive at this time, I just opened a second shell on the server and ran <code>watch -n 1</code> with the generation command.</p>
